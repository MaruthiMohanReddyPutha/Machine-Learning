# Classification of Hand-written digits using Logistic Regression and Convolutional Neural Networks
* The classification task will be to recognize a 28 X 28 grayscale handwritten digit image and identify it as a digit among 0, 1, 2, ... , 9. And following are the tasks performed.
  * Implement logistic regression, train it on the MNIST digit images and tune hyperparameters
  * Implement single hidden layer neural network, train it on the MNIST digit images and tune hyperparameters such as the number of units in the hidden layer
  * Use a publicly available convolutional neural network package, train it on the MNIST digit images and tune hyperparameters
  * Test your MNIST trained models on USPS test data and compare the performance with that of the MNIST data.
 * The USPS data is provided by Prof Dr. Sargur Srihari.
