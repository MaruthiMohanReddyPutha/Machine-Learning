# Probabilistic Distributions and Bayesian Networks
* In this project we are concerned about the probability distributions of several variables. And Python is used to evaluate sufficient statistics: mean and variance of univariate distributions and covariance and correlation coefficients of pairs of variables. And these statistics are then used to create compact representations of joint probability distributions known as Bayesian networks.
